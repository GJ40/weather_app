# Weather App

## Project Overview

The Weather App is a simple, user-friendly application that allows users to get real-time weather information for any location. The app fetches weather data using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and displays it in a clean and intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Get current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions.
- **Location Search**: Search for weather information by city name.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the app, including layout, colors, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processing user input, and dynamically updating the UI.
